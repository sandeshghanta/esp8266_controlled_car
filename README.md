# ESP8266_controlled_car
This project is part of our IoT elective. This project provides an ESP8266 enabled DIY car which can be controlled using laptop or voice commands.
### Use case of the project:
The project aims at solving the issue of reaching un-reachable places. Home automation can easily be ported to this project with suitable changes in the hardware.  
### Potential Users
Anyone who is facing the issue of tracking/surveying a large area with limited manpower can easily modify this project to track whatever is necessary
### Brief Technical Description
We can control an ordinary DIY car using a laptop or using voice commands. We will be sending instructions to the car via WiFi. This increases the range in which the car can be operated.
